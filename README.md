# Visual Programming (or Graphical Programming, whatever)

This repository contains assignments, implemented as part of the course *Visual Programming (Programarea vizualÄƒ)*, which means doing graphical stuff and user interfaces, not connecting nodes in a visual programming language (I'm happy not to study *that*).

PR's with grammar corrections, bug fixes, improvement suggestions or translations are very welcome.

Leave a star as a way to say "Thank you". Enjoy!

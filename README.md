# Visual Programming (or Graphical Programming, whatever)

This repository contains assignments, implemented as part of the course *Visual Programming (Programarea vizualÄƒ)*, which means doing graphical stuff and user interfaces, not connecting nodes in a visual programming language (I'm happy not to study *that*).

To be able to run the projects, you have to manually install [.NET6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0), which also comes as a workload with Visual Studio.
Use any editor, I'm using mostly VS Code and sometimes Rider when I want to peek at the source code of WPF.
The code won't compile on significantly earlier versions of .NET, since it uses C# 10 features.

PR's with grammar corrections, bug fixes, improvement suggestions or translations are very welcome.

Leave a star as a way to say "Thank you". Enjoy!
